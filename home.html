    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <h2>My Gym Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      Going to the gym is more than just exercise for me—it’s a discipline and a mindset.
      I spend my time pushing heavy weight, especially on compound lifts like the bench press,
      constantly chasing strength, control, and progression. Each session is about showing up,
      putting in focused effort, and improving on the last rep from yesterday.

      The results don’t stay in the gym. Building muscle and staying consistent carries over
      into everyday life, boosting confidence and presence. It’s about earning the physique
      through hard work and enjoying the payoff that comes with commitment.
